## Task Overview

We are thrilled to present an engaging introductory task for aspirants of the Front-End Developer role. Before diving into your tasks, please ensure to read all the steps thoroughly. This assignment aims to evaluate your proficiency in constructing a fully functional website based on a given design specification and effectively integrating it with a content management system.

### Primary Objectives

We request that all development work be carried out on a designated feature branch. Please do not work directly on the main branch. Once you have cloned the repository, create and switch to your own feature branch.

1. **Clone this Repository and Install Dependencies:**
    - Clone this repository and install all necessary dependencies to set up the project environment on your local machine. This step is crucial for ensuring that you have all the required tools and libraries to begin development.
2. **Build the Website from a Figma File:**
    - You are provided with a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/hg9zOPp9RCGb5DhZEKQHlB/VERTIFL%C3%93RA-DEVTEST?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=8a6yjEUQyrhAx2NI-1) containing the design specifications for the website. Your task is to accurately translate this design into a fully functional website.
3. **Contentful Integration:**
    - The website is already connected to Contentful, a content management platform. You will need to pull all the necessary data from Contentful to populate the website, except for the references slider on the bottom, which is not fed from Contentful.
4. **Conventional Git Commits:**
   - Adhere to conventional commit standards when making commits to the GitHub repository. This involves using structured commit messages that clearly describe the purpose and scope of each change, enhancing code traceability and project management.

### Optional Tasks

To further demonstrate your technical prowess, you are encouraged to complete the following optional tasks:

1. **Mobile Optimization:**
    - Enhance the website's responsiveness and performance on mobile devices. This involves optimizing layouts, images, and interactivity to ensure a seamless user experience on various screen sizes and mobile platforms.
2. **Type Definition for Data Object:**
    - Create a TypeScript type definition for the `{data}` object, which is the result of a GraphQL query. The current structure is `{data: any}`. Your task is to provide a more specific type definition based on the expected GraphQL result structure, thereby enhancing the code's robustness and readability.
4. **Simplify the GraphQL Query with Fragments:**
    - The project uses GraphQL for data fetching. We challenge you to create fragments to simplify the GraphQL queries. You can find possible fragmentable types commented in the GraphQL query itself. This approach will demonstrate your ability to optimize data fetching and manipulation.

### Submission Guidelines

- Ensure that your code adheres to industry-standard coding practices.
- Upon completion, submit a pull request to a designated feature branch on the GitHub repository for review.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Accuracy in translating the Figma design into a functional website.
- Code quality, including readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.
- Successful integration with Contentful and efficient data handling.
- For optional tasks, the effectiveness and implementation of type definitions, GraphQL fragments, and mobile optimization.

We look forward to reviewing your submission and seeing your approach to solving real-world development challenges. This task is a great opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity as a front-end developer.
